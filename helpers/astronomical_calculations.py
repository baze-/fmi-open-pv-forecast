"""
This file contains functions for retrieving information on the sun angles and air mass between sun and the pv panels.
Functions utilize tools from PVlib.

Angle of incidence is the angle between the solar panel normal angle and the angle of sunlight hitting the panel.
Solar azimuth and Zenith are the spherical coordinate angles used for describing the angle of the sun.
Air mass is required by the perez model.

Functions from this file are mainly required for irradiance transpositions.


Terminology:
Zenith(point): point directly above the observer.
Zenith angle(degrees): distance in degrees from the point above.
solar apparent zenith(degrees): apparent distance of the sun from the zenith as observed at the location through the atmosphere.
this is in contrast to solar zenith which is the actual sun position. The difference between these two zenith values is
caused by the atmosphere.
AOI(degrees): angle of incidence. Difference between solar panel normal vector and the vector of incoming sunlight. At AOI of 0,
reflections are minimal and relative surface area is at 1. At 90, panels do not receive direct sunlight and relative
surface area is 0.
Azimuth(degrees): 0 for north, 90 for east, 180 for south, 270 for west.
